# Drive routines
All drive routines are dependant on the dual_mc33926 Motor Driver

## battery_drain.py
The purpose of this routine is to drain the battery of the motors for testing. It operates by running the wheels forwards for 30 seconds, and runs them backwards for 30 seconds. Routinely looping through this simple set of instructions forever or until the battery runs out.
